Step 1: Identify Entities in the System
For a blog application, typical entities might include:

User (Key Entity)

Represents users of the blog application.
Post (Key Entity)

Represents blog posts created by users.
Comment (Weak Entity)

Represents comments made on blog posts. Itâ€™s a weak entity because it depends on the existence of a Post.
Category (Key Entity)

Represents categories under which posts can be grouped.
Tag (Associative Entity)

Represents tags that can be associated with posts.
Role (Key Entity)

Represents roles assigned to users, like Admin, Author, etc.
User_Role (Associative Entity)

Represents the relationship between users and their roles.
Step 2: Identify Relationships Between Entities
User - Post: A user can create many posts, but each post is created by one user.

Relationship: One-to-Many
Post - Comment: A post can have many comments, but each comment is associated with one post.

Relationship: One-to-Many
Post - Category: A post can belong to one category, but a category can have many posts.

Relationship: One-to-Many
Post - Tag: A post can have many tags, and a tag can be associated with many posts.

Relationship: Many-to-Many
User - User_Role: A user can have multiple roles, and a role can be assigned to many users.

Relationship: Many-to-Many
Step 3: Identify Cardinality and Ordinality of the Relationships
User - Post: (1

Post - Comment: (1

Post - Category: (1
